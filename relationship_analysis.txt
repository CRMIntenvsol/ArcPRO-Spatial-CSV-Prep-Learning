alluvium + paleo: 114 occurrences
  - The discovery of this site, buried approximately 7–8 m below the top of the Elm Fork flood plain just below the Lake Ray Roberts dam, suggests that well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in northcentral Texas will only be found by examining deeply stratified Holocene alluvium in modern flood plain situations
  - ” The site is situated within the West Fork Paleosol and is covered by 50 – 200 cm of alluvium
  - The Pilot Point Alloformation All of the prehistoric archaeology at 41TR198 is contained within the buried soil formed at the top of the Pilot Point alloformation, which was named the “West Fork Soil” (when not buried) or the “West Fork Paleosol” (when buried by recent alluvium) by Ferring (1986b)
  - Within Block 3, the Pilot Point alluvium ranged in texture from silty clay loam in the upper part of the West Fork Paleosol, to a silty clay at depth

  - At sites 41TR198 and 41TR170 the lithic assemblage is dominated by cherts found in the Uvalde gravels on local drainage divides or cherts more commonly found in Central Texas

loam + historic: 76 occurrences
  - The fine-grained overbank sediments that comprise the site matrix ranged from silty clay at depth to silty clay loam near the top of the West Fork Paleosol, and these deposits appear to preserve numerous, thin prehistoric occupation surfaces
  - ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS When work at 41NV96 began, it was hoped that vertical separation between the Archaic and Late Prehistoric components could be demonstrated, especially for those areas of the site where the sandy loam deposit was relatively deep
  - Artifacts diagnostic of both the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods were recovered from a deposit consisting of approximately 90 cm of sandy loam overlying clay in the units located atop the knolls
  - The soil at the site, a sandy loam, is distinctly 41RR203 darker than the surrounding soil, suggesting that an historic sheet or yard trash midden is preserved at This appears to be an Archaic period site 41RR205; no shovel testing was conducted during located on a topographic high overlooking the our cursory reconnaissance to verify the presence confl uence of Pond Creek and Salt Well Slough; of a midden deposit

  - Terrace sites are reported to predominantly contain lithic scatter and upland sites are typically found where natural quartzite and chert deposits occur on the surface (Hays et al
  - Hayes notes that terrace sites consist mainly of lithic scatter and upland sites are found in areas where lithic raw materials may have been procured
  - Lithic manufacture camps are primarily associated with sandstone (45%) with a secondary presence (34%) in alluvial and fluvatile terrace deposits

clay + paleo: 71 occurrences
  - Within Block 3, the Pilot Point alluvium ranged in texture from silty clay loam in the upper part of the West Fork Paleosol, to a silty clay at depth
  - In a few exposures the sandier lower portion of the recent alluvium was absent and the A horizon formed within the more clayey facies was clearly welding into the West Fork Paleosol, and in these trench exposures the Recent alluvium was often difficult to distinguish from the Pilot Point in strong direct sunlight
  - The fine-grained overbank sediments that comprise the site matrix ranged from silty clay at depth to silty clay loam near the top of the West Fork Paleosol, and these deposits appear to preserve numerous, thin prehistoric occupation surfaces
  - The top of the Pilot Point alluvium exhibits a dark, clay-rich Vertisol, the West Fork paleosol, which encapsulates the prehistoric archeological assemblages of both sites
  - Significant quantities of shell, burned clay, and lithics in Units 3 (220 to 260 cm bs) and 6 (230 to 260 cm bs) 80 to 110 cm into the West Fork soil may indicate a fourth concentration~or the earlier portion of the same concentration represented by Units 4 and 5 (60 to 90 cm into the paleosol)

  - Based on those factors, the occupants at the site likely utilized local lithic sources (comprised primarily of small Ogallala gravels and cobbles that were likely opportunistically collected in eroded interfluvial upland settings or within stream channel gravel bar deposits) to manufacture smaller-sized formal and informal tools from multidirectional core blanks
  - The relatively small nature of the core and hammerstones supports the reliance of lithic production on the locally abundant, moderately-sized Ogallala gravels typically available along interfluvial upland ridges and within stream gravels across the region

floodplain + paleo: 56 occurrences
  - The discovery of the Aubrey site suggests that well-preserved Paleoindian sites in North-Central Texas will only be found by examining deeply-stratified Holocene alluvium in floodplain contexts
  - Based on Phase I survey data, the encapsulation of cultural materials within a cumulic paleosol at sites 41DL553 and 41DL554 indicates the sites were occupied during a period of relative floodplain surface stability or, at the very least, during a period of low alluvial sedimentation rates
  - Its context at the top of the paleosol suggests that much of the Recent alluvium (at least the distal margins) was deposited during the 20th century, which in turn suggests that much of the West Fork paleosol was in fact exposed across the floodplain as a surface soil until sometime in the early 20th century
  - In the present investigation at site 41TR170 on the Clear Fork, the paleosol is also present and is a cumulic over-thickened A horizon soil, formed by slow fluvial aggradation on the floodplain over a comparatively long period of time
  - However, in contrast to the cumulic soil depositional environment, the post-paleosol alluvium likely accumulated during fewer flood events, but each flood produced a thicker layer of sandy sediment deposited on the wooded floodplain

floodplain + archaic: 56 occurrences
  - Previous investigations along the West Fork Trinity River (Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986) indicate that primary contexts for Early and Middle Archaic sites could occur deeply buried within floodplain alluvium
  - Throughout Northcentral Texas, Late Archaic period occupation sites are relatively common in the uplands, and a relatively large number of shallow buried sites are known from the Trinity River floodplain (Ferring 1990a:51)
  - The site represents repeated occupation during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods for the purpose of acquiring riverine and floodplain foods
  - It appears that the floodplain habitat that in- cluded permanent vegetation, trees, downed limbs, CONCLUSIONS and leaf and forest debris along the Trinity River adjacent to 41DL350 did not vary over time from The Dalbey site is a deeply stratified Late the lower portion of the deposits to the present Archaic to Late Prehistoric site that exhibits day
  - Late Archaic Settlement Patterns (3500-1250BP) During the Late Archaic there appears to be a notable shift of site location to floodplains, first order tributaries and minor tributary streams (Prikryl, 1990: 74; Skinner and Ferring, 1999:9)

  - The effects of sheet erosion and gullying of terraces is difficult to assess, although this may be a factor contributing to the very low frequency of Paleoindian through Middle Archaic sites in the project area
  - Because of deep burial of prehistoric sites below the floodplains, and because of good visibility of sites on the terraces, the majority of recorded sites, ranging in age from Paleoindian to Historic, occur in terrace settings
  - The Late Paleoindian occupation is post-depositional and located in terrace deposits
  - Similar to Paleoindian sites, Early Archaic sites are located on terraces along tributaries of major rivers, but sites adjacent to larger river channels may be deeply buried

alluvium + historic: 28 occurrences
  - The Pilot Point Alloformation All of the prehistoric archaeology at 41TR198 is contained within the buried soil formed at the top of the Pilot Point alloformation, which was named the “West Fork Soil” (when not buried) or the “West Fork Paleosol” (when buried by recent alluvium) by Ferring (1986b)
