5. CULTURAL OBSERVATIONS
   - Prehistoric Class 3 Sites: 67
   - Potential Historic/Unclassified Class 3 Sites: 18

6. BURNED CLAY ANALYSIS
   - Total Sites with Burned Clay: 160
   - Burned Clay ONLY (No Burned Rock): 39
   - Co-occurrence with Class 1 (Scatters): 88 (55.0%)
   - Co-occurrence with Class 2 (Hearths): 111 (69.4%)
   - Co-occurrence with Class 3 (Ovens): 14 (8.8%)
   - Burned Clay in Prehistoric Context: 146 (91.2%)

7. KEY FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS
   - PREVALENCE: Dispersed scatters (Class 1) are the most common manifestation of burned rock in this dataset.
   - PREHISTORIC CONTEXT: A majority of Class 3 sites contain prehistoric evidence, supporting the classification of earth ovens.

   - NEXT STEPS:
     * Use ArcPro to plot 'Class 3' sites. Perform a Hot Spot Analysis to identify intensive processing zones.
     * Filter the dataset using the 'Is_Prehistoric' column to create a clean prehistoric distribution map.
